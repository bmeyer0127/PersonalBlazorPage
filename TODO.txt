#CURRENT TASK############################################################################################################

- Get better and more equal spacing for these
	- For this maybe use separate div, but empty div feels weird
	- Maybe want to keep using psudo elements, but not super sure
	- Could also be a situation where I want to use display: flex but I need to get better that using that

- God I hate using CSS. Find more tools or games to get better with it. I hate it right now
	- Like it's super cool but I feel like I am always chasing my own tail and reinventing the wheel
	- So much functionality that I always forget about

#TODO####################################################################################################################

- Okay, first:
	- I wanna find colors that mesh better together, that shouldn't be too big of a problem. Just play with some tools
	- I want to get better at fucking with linear-gradient.
		- Or find a different tool. I feel like it isn't working how I want it to
		- Or does not have the functionality that I want it to have.

# Separate home page into three sections:
	# Top: space looking aesthetic but not too stupid looking
		# Option to click on "space" to see professional qualifications
	# Center: name section maybe with a sky aesthetic
		# Will probably add some cute easter eggs a-la Stardew Valley
	# Bottom: earthy aesthetic
		# Option to click on "earth" to see personal qualities

# Top needs a after psudo element to create a gradient between space and sky
# Bottom needs a before psudo element to create a gradient between sky and earth
